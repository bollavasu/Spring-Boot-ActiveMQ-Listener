We need the following things for ActiveMQ Listener

1)we need the broker url in application.properties

  spring.activemq.broker-url=tcp://localhost:61616
  
2)ActiveMQ Listener class  (We don't need to configure this class any where, @JmsListener method will be called automatically)

  @JmsListener(destination = "VasuQueue") method will be called when a message comes to the queue
  
  
1)Start the ActiveMQ sender application and send the messages

2)Start the ActiveMQ Listener application and see the consumed messages in the console

mvn clean install

mvn spring-boot:run
